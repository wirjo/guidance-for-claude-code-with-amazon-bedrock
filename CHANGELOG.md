## [Unreleased] - OTLP-First Metrics

### Changed

- **OTLP-first monitoring**: OTEL Collector now exports to CloudWatch OTLP endpoint (for PromQL dashboards). EMF export is conditionally added only when analytics is enabled, controlled by the `EnableAnalytics` CloudFormation parameter.
- **PromQL dashboard**: Replaced all Lambda-backed custom widgets with native PromQL chart widgets — zero Lambda functions in the dashboard stack
- **Quota monitoring**: Quota monitor Lambda now queries CloudWatch Prometheus-compatible API (`/api/v1/query`) for usage data instead of relying on MetricsAggregator
- **Auth templates**: Removed `cloudwatch:namespace` IAM conditions (OTLP metrics don't use CW namespaces)
- **Dashboard deployment**: No longer requires S3 packaging (no Lambda functions to package)

### Removed

- **MetricsAggregator Lambda**: Replaced by PromQL queries — no longer needed to pre-compute metrics
- **DynamoDB MetricsTable**: Dashboard reads directly from OTLP metrics via PromQL
- **Custom widget Lambda functions**: All 16 widget Lambdas replaced by PromQL chart widgets
- **metrics-aggregation.yaml**: Standalone aggregation stack removed
- **MetricsAggregatorQuotaPolicy**: Cross-stack IAM policy no longer needed

### Kept (unchanged)

- Analytics pipeline (optional) — Kinesis Firehose → S3 → Athena for long-term historical SQL
- ECS/ALB/VPC networking infrastructure
- Quota monitoring DynamoDB tables (UserQuotaMetrics, QuotaPolicies)

## [2.3.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- **Per-user quota monitoring**: Fine-grained token quota controls with daily/monthly limits, alert/block enforcement modes, and DynamoDB-backed quota policies
- **SageMaker plugin**: Async inference skill for SageMaker endpoint integration
- **Bedrock plugin**: Tool-use structured output skill for Bedrock model integration
- **ML-training plugin**: GRPO fine-tuning skill for custom model training workflows
- **Claude Opus 4.6 support**: New model added with EU/AU CRIS profile support and correct quota codes
- **ALB JWT validation**: JWT validation for OTEL Collector endpoint via Application Load Balancer
- **OIDC id_token caching**: Caches OIDC id_token to avoid redundant browser-based re-authentication on every credential refresh

### Fixed

- Fixed quota stack S3 bucket lookup targeting wrong CloudFormation stack
- Fixed Auth0 issuer URL missing trailing slash for quota API JWT authorizer
- Fixed vpc_config flattening and nested rebuild when loading existing profile
- Fixed Opus 4.6 EU/AU entries missing from init.py display dicts and dashboard throttle metrics
- Fixed OTEL telemetry UI freezes with two-layer caching on otel-helper
- Fixed browser popup appearing every ~1h by caching OTEL headers indefinitely
- Fixed id_token expiry buffer reduced from 10 minutes to 60 seconds
- Fixed hardcoded legacy model IDs in test command replaced with configured inference profile

### Other

  - Auth0's OIDC issuer includes trailing slash per OAuth 2.0 spec
  - Prevents "issuer mismatch" errors during Direct IAM federation
  - Updated CloudFormation template parameter documentation with supported domain formats

- **Auth0 session name sanitization**: Fixed AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity errors for Auth0 users
  - Auth0 uses pipe-delimited format in sub claims (e.g., `auth0|12345`)
  - AWS RoleSessionName regex `[\w+=,.@-]*` doesn't allow pipe characters
  - Automatically sanitize invalid characters to hyphens in session names
  - Prevents "Member must satisfy regular expression pattern" validation errors

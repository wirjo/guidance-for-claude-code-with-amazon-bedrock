## Quick Start

This guidance integrates Claude Code with your existing OIDC identity provider (Okta, Azure AD, Auth0, or Cognito User Pools) to provide federated access to Amazon Bedrock.

### What You Need

**Existing Identity Provider:**
You must have an active OIDC provider with the ability to create application registrations. The guidance federates this IdP with AWS IAM to issue temporary credentials for Bedrock access.

**AWS Environment:**

- AWS account with IAM and CloudFormation permissions
- Amazon Bedrock activated in target regions
- Python 3.10+ development environment for deployment

### What Gets Deployed

The deployment creates:

- IAM OIDC Provider or Cognito Identity Pool for federation
- IAM roles with scoped Bedrock access policies
- Platform-specific installation packages (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Optional: OpenTelemetry monitoring infrastructure

**Deployment time:** 2-3 hours for initial setup including IdP configuration.

See [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md) for complete step-by-step deployment instructions.

### Extend to Claude Cowork

If you've deployed this guidance for Claude Code, extend it to Claude Cowork (Claude Desktop) with one command:

```bash
poetry run ccwb cowork generate
```

This generates MDM configuration files (JSON, macOS .mobileconfig, Windows .reg) using your existing deployment profile. See the [CoWork 3P Guide](assets/docs/COWORK_3P.md) for setup and deployment details.

## Architecture Overview

This guidance uses Direct IAM OIDC federation as the recommended authentication pattern. This provides temporary AWS credentials with complete user attribution for audit trails and usage monitoring.

**Alternative:** Cognito Identity Pool is also supported for legacy IdP integrations. See [Deployment Guide](assets/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for comparison.

### Authentication Flow (Direct IAM Federation)

![Architecture Diagram](assets/images/credential-flow-direct-diagram.png)

1. **User initiates authentication**: User requests access to Amazon Bedrock through Claude Code or Claude Cowork
2. **OIDC authentication**: User authenticates with their OIDC provider and receives an ID token
3. **Token submission to IAM**: Application sends the OIDC ID token to Amazon Cognito
4. **IAM returns credentials**: AWS IAM validates and returns temporary AWS credentials
5. **Access Amazon Bedrock**: Application uses the temporary credentials to call Amazon Bedrock
6. **Bedrock response**: Amazon Bedrock processes the request and returns the response

### Optional: Deploy Without SSO Authentication

**New in v2.1+:** You can now deploy the observability and analytics solution without SSO authentication. This is ideal for:

- **Internal tools and development environments** where user authentication isn't required
- **Analytics-only deployments** where you want usage tracking without managing IdP integrations
- **Simplified deployments** using AWS IAM roles for access control

When SSO authentication is disabled:

- **Access Control**: Uses AWS IAM roles and policies directly (no OIDC provider required)
- **Identity Detection**: Automatically detects how users authenticate to AWS:
  - **AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO) users**: Real username/email is extracted from the assumed-role ARN — no configuration needed. Each SSO user gets full identity attribution (name, email, permission set) in the observability dashboard.
  - **IAM users**: Username is extracted from the IAM user ARN.
  - **Non-SSO assumed roles**: Usage is tracked using a hashed anonymous identifier (consistent per IAM principal, but individual identity cannot be determined).
- **No IdP Configuration**: Skip OIDC provider setup entirely — if your organization uses AWS IAM Identity Center for Bedrock access, identity "just works"

**When to use this:**
- You're deploying only the observability/analytics infrastructure
- Your users already have AWS IAM access to Bedrock
- You want simplified deployment without IdP integration
- You need usage monitoring but don't require individual user authentication

**When to use SSO authentication:**
- You need centralized access control through your identity provider
- You require user-level attribution with real identities (email, department, etc.)
- You want to enforce organization-wide access policies
- You need detailed audit trails with user information

To deploy without SSO authentication, select **"None (use existing AWS credentials)"** when prompted for the authentication method during `ccwb init`. The deployment will skip the authentication stack and use anonymous tracking for metrics.

> **New in v2.2+:** IAM Identity Center is now a first-class authentication option. Select **"AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO)"** in `ccwb init` to get guided setup, `~/.aws/config` generation, and the correct CloudFormation stack — without the undocumented workaround of disabling SSO. See the [IAM Identity Center Setup Guide](assets/docs/providers/iam-identity-center-setup.md) for details.

## Authentication Modes

This guidance supports three identity paths. All paths deliver per-user identity resolution, centralized access control, audit trails, and usage monitoring.

| Mode | `ccwb init` choice | Identity Source | Session Length | Quota Enforcement | Best For |
|------|--------------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| **External IdP (OIDC)** | `OIDC / Direct IdP` | Okta, Azure AD, Auth0, Cognito User Pools JWT claims | Refresh token lifetime | ✅ Full | Orgs with an existing enterprise IdP |
| **AWS IAM Identity Center** | `AWS IAM Identity Center` | `AWSReservedSSO_*` IAM role ARN (email + permission set) | Up to 90 days (recommended: 7 days) | ❌ Not available | Orgs on native AWS identity, or where OIDC localhost callback is blocked |
| **None** | `None` | IAM user ARN or hashed role principal | AWS credential TTL | ❌ Not available | Internal tools / analytics-only deployments |

**Choosing a path:**

- Use **External IdP (OIDC)** when you need full quota enforcement, rich user attribution (department, team, cost centre from JWT claims), and have an OIDC provider (Okta, Azure AD, Auth0, or Cognito).
- Use **AWS IAM Identity Center** when your team already uses IAM IDC, or when corporate policies block `localhost:8400`, or when you want sessions up to 7 days without browser re-prompts. See [IAM Identity Center Setup Guide](assets/docs/providers/iam-identity-center-setup.md).
- Use **None** when deploying the observability/analytics stack only, or when users already have IAM access to Bedrock and need no additional authentication layer.

- MDM configuration deployed by IT admin (generated via `ccwb cowork generate`)

**No AWS account required** - users authenticate through your organization's identity provider and receive temporary credentials automatically.

**No Python, Poetry, or Git required** - users receive pre-built installation packages from IT administrators.

### Supported AWS Regions

The guidance can be deployed in any AWS region that supports:

- IAM OIDC Providers or Amazon Cognito Identity Pools
- Amazon Bedrock
- (Optional) Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) tasks and Amazon CloudWatch dashboards
- (Optional) Amazon Athena, AWS Glue, AWS Lambda, and Amazon Data Firehose resources
- (Optional) AWS CodeBuild

Both AWS Commercial and AWS GovCloud (US) partitions are supported. See [AWS Partition Support](#aws-partition-support) for details.

### Cross-Region Inference

Claude Code uses Amazon Bedrock's cross-region inference for optimal performance and availability. During setup, you can:

- Select your preferred Claude model (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
- Choose a cross-region profile (US, Europe, APAC) for optimal regional routing
- Select a specific source region within your profile for model inference

This automatically routes requests across multiple AWS regions to ensure the best response times and highest availability. Modern Claude models (3.7+) require cross-region inference for access.

### Platform Support

The authentication tools support all major platforms:

| Platform | Architecture          | Build Method                | Installation |
| -------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------ |
| Windows  | x64                   | AWS CodeBuild (Nuitka)      | install.bat  |
| macOS    | ARM64 (Apple Silicon) | Native (PyInstaller)        | install.sh   |
| macOS    | Intel (x86_64)        | Cross-compile (PyInstaller) | install.sh   |
| macOS    | Universal (both)      | Universal2 (PyInstaller)    | install.sh   |
| Linux    | x86_64                | Docker (PyInstaller)        | install.sh   |
| Linux    | ARM64                 | Docker (PyInstaller)        | install.sh   |

**Build System:**

The package builder automatically creates executables for all platforms using PyInstaller (macOS/Linux) and AWS CodeBuild with Nuitka (Windows). All builds create standalone executables - no Python installation required for end users.

See [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md#platform-builds) for detailed build configuration.

## AWS Partition Support

This guidance supports deployment across multiple AWS partitions with a single, unified codebase. The same CloudFormation templates and deployment process work seamlessly in both AWS Commercial and AWS GovCloud (US) regions.

### Supported Partitions

| Partition | Regions | Use Cases |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **AWS Commercial** (`aws`) | All regions where Bedrock is available | Standard commercial workloads |
| **AWS GovCloud (US)** (`aws-us-gov`) | us-gov-west-1, us-gov-east-1 | US government agencies, contractors, and regulated workloads |

### How It Works

The guidance automatically detects the AWS partition at deployment time and configures resources appropriately:

**Resource ARNs:**
- CloudFormation uses the `${AWS::Partition}` pseudo-parameter
- Automatically resolves to `aws` or `aws-us-gov`
- Example: `arn:${AWS::Partition}:bedrock:*::foundation-model/*`

**Service Principals:**
- Cognito Identity service principals are partition-specific
- Commercial: `cognito-identity.amazonaws.com`
- GovCloud West: `cognito-identity-us-gov.amazonaws.com`
- GovCloud East: `cognito-identity.us-gov-east-1.amazonaws.com`
- IAM role trust policies automatically use the correct principal based on region

**S3 Endpoints:**
- Commercial: `s3.region.amazonaws.com`
- GovCloud: `s3.region.amazonaws.com`

### Deploying to AWS GovCloud

Follow the same [Quick Start](#quick-start) instructions with your GovCloud credentials active. During `ccwb init`, select a GovCloud region (us-gov-west-1 or us-gov-east-1) and the wizard will automatically configure GovCloud-compatible models and endpoints.

**GovCloud-Specific Considerations:**

1. **Credentials:** GovCloud requires separate AWS credentials from commercial accounts
2. **Model IDs:** GovCloud uses region-prefixed model IDs (e.g., `us-gov.anthropic.*`)
3. **FIPS Endpoints:** Cognito hosted UI uses `{prefix}.auth-fips.{region}.amazoncognito.com`
4. **Managed Login:** Branding must be created for each Cognito app client

### Validation

After deployment, verify the correct partition configuration:

```bash
# Check IAM role ARN uses correct partition
aws iam get-role \
  --role-name BedrockCognitoFederatedRole \
  --region <region> \
  --query 'Role.Arn'

# Expected ARN formats:
# Commercial: arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:role/BedrockCognitoFederatedRole
# GovCloud: arn:aws-us-gov:iam::ACCOUNT:role/BedrockCognitoFederatedRole
```

### Backward Compatibility

✅ **All changes are fully backward compatible**

- Existing commercial deployments continue to work without modification
- CloudFormation updates can be applied to existing stacks
- No changes to user-facing functionality
- No data migration required

## What Gets Deployed

### Authentication Infrastructure

The `ccwb deploy` command creates:

**IAM Resources:**

- IAM OIDC Provider (for Direct IAM federation) or Cognito Identity Pool (for legacy IdP)
- IAM role with trust relationship for federated access
- IAM policies scoped to:
  - Bedrock model invocation in configured regions
  - CloudWatch metric publishing (if monitoring enabled)

**User Distribution Packages:**

- Platform-specific executables (Windows, macOS ARM64/Intel, Linux x64/ARM64)
- Installation scripts that configure AWS CLI credential process
- Pre-configured settings (OIDC provider, model selection, monitoring endpoints)

### Distribution Options (Optional)

After building packages, you can share them with users in three ways:

| Method                | Best For               | Authentication                 |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Manual Sharing**    | Any size team          | None                           |
| **Presigned S3 URLs** | Automated distribution | None                           |
| **Landing Page**      | Self-service portal    | IdP (Okta/Azure/Auth0/Cognito) |

**Manual Sharing:** Zip the `dist/` folder and share via email or internal file sharing. No additional infrastructure required.

**Presigned URLs:** Generate time-limited S3 URLs for direct downloads. Automated but requires S3 bucket setup.

**Landing Page:** Self-service portal with IdP authentication, platform detection, and custom domain support. Full automation with compliance features.

See [Distribution Comparison](assets/docs/distribution/comparison.md) for detailed setup guides.

### Monitoring Infrastructure (Optional)

Enable usage visibility with OpenTelemetry monitoring stack:

**Components:**

- VPC and networking resources (or use existing VPC)
- ECS Fargate cluster running OpenTelemetry collector
- Application Load Balancer for metric ingestion
- CloudWatch dashboards with real-time usage metrics
- DynamoDB for metrics aggregation

**Optional Analytics Add-On:**

- Kinesis Data Firehose streaming metrics to S3
- S3 data lake for long-term storage
- Amazon Athena for SQL queries on historical data
- AWS Glue Data Catalog for schema management

See [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md) for step-by-step deployment instructions.

## Monitoring and Operations

Optional OpenTelemetry monitoring provides comprehensive usage visibility for cost attribution, capacity planning, and productivity insights.

### Available Metrics

**Token Economics:**

- Input/output/cache token consumption by user, model, and type
- Prompt caching effectiveness (hit rates, token savings)
- Cost attribution by user, team, or department

**Code Activity:**

- Lines of code written vs accepted (productivity signal)
- File operations breakdown (edits, searches, reads)
- Programming language distribution

**Operational Health:**

- Active users and top consumers
- Usage patterns (hourly/daily heatmaps)
- Authentication and API error rates

### Infrastructure

The monitoring stack (deployed with `ccwb deploy monitoring`) includes:

- ECS Fargate running OpenTelemetry collector
- Application Load Balancer for metric ingestion
- CloudWatch dashboards for real-time visualization
- Optional: S3 data lake + Athena for historical analysis

See [Monitoring Guide](assets/docs/MONITORING.md) for setup details and dashboard examples.

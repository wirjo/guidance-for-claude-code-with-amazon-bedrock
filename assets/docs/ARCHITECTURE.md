# Technical Architecture

This document provides technical details about the Claude Code authentication system architecture, design decisions, and integration patterns.

> **Note**: For deployment instructions, prerequisites, and operational guides, see the [main README](../../README.md).

## System Overview

The Claude Code authentication system enables secure, scalable access to Amazon Bedrock by federating enterprise identity providers through AWS Cognito. The architecture follows zero-trust principles with complete audit trails.

## Component Architecture

### Authentication Components

The core authentication component is the credential process, implemented as a native Go binary in `source/go/`. This implements a complete OAuth2/OIDC client with PKCE flow for secure authentication without client secrets. Go cross-compilation produces native statically-linked binaries for all 5 platforms (macOS ARM64/Intel, Linux x64/ARM64, Windows x64) from a single build, eliminating the need for per-platform build toolchains. The credential process supports multiple identity providers including Okta, Azure AD, Auth0, and Cognito User Pools through a flexible provider registry system. Once authenticated, credentials are cached either in the operating system's secure keyring or in session files, depending on the organization's preference. The implementation follows the AWS CLI credential process protocol, making it transparent to any AWS SDK or tool.

The management CLI in `source/claude_code_with_bedrock/` provides IT administrators with tools to deploy and manage the infrastructure. Built on the Cleo framework, it offers an intuitive command-line interface for initialization, deployment, and package generation. This component is used only during setup and is not distributed to end users.

### AWS Infrastructure Components

The authentication infrastructure supports two federation methods. With Direct IAM Federation, an IAM OIDC Provider creates the trust relationship between the organization's identity provider and AWS, allowing direct token exchange via STS. With Cognito Identity Pool, Amazon Cognito acts as an intermediary that federates OIDC tokens into AWS credentials. Both methods use IAM roles that grant permissions specifically for Amazon Bedrock model invocation in configured regions. Every API call includes session tags containing the user's email and subject claim, ensuring complete attribution in CloudTrail logs.

#### IAM Permissions

The IAM role assigned to authenticated users grants the following Amazon Bedrock permissions:

- `bedrock:InvokeModel` - Invoke foundation models for text generation
- `bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream` - Invoke models with streaming responses
- `bedrock:ListFoundationModels` - List available foundation models
- `bedrock:GetFoundationModel` - Get details about specific models
- `bedrock:GetFoundationModelAvailability` - Check model availability in regions
- `bedrock:ListInferenceProfiles` - List available cross-region inference profiles
- `bedrock:GetInferenceProfile` - Get details about specific inference profiles

These permissions are scoped to the configured regions and enable users to discover and invoke models through cross-region inference profiles, ensuring optimal performance and availability.

- `bedrock:InvokeModel` - Invoke foundation models for text generation
- `bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream` - Invoke models with streaming responses
- `bedrock:ListFoundationModels` - List available foundation models
- `bedrock:GetFoundationModel` - Get details about specific models
- `bedrock:GetFoundationModelAvailability` - Check model availability in regions
- `bedrock:ListInferenceProfiles` - List available cross-region inference profiles
- `bedrock:GetInferenceProfile` - Get details about specific inference profiles

These permissions are scoped to the configured regions and enable users to discover and invoke models through cross-region inference profiles, ensuring optimal performance and availability.

When monitoring is enabled, the solution supports two deployment modes:

**Central Mode** (default): A shared, server-side collector ingests metrics from all clients.
- Client → ALB → ECS OTEL Collector → CloudWatch OTLP + EMF logs
- Deploys a VPC with public subnets, an ECS Fargate cluster running the OpenTelemetry collector, and an Application Load Balancer as the ingestion endpoint. When analytics is enabled, the collector additionally writes EMF logs to CloudWatch Logs for the analytics pipeline (Athena SQL over historical data).

**Sidecar Mode**: Each client runs a local OpenTelemetry collector that exports directly to CloudWatch.
- Client → localhost:4318 → Local OTEL Collector → CloudWatch OTLP (SigV4)
- No server-side networking or ECS infrastructure is required. The local collector authenticates to CloudWatch using SigV4 with the user's federated credentials. Only the CloudWatch dashboard stack is deployed on the AWS side.

For organizations requiring detailed analytics, the optional analytics stack provides comprehensive usage analysis capabilities. Kinesis Data Firehose continuously streams metrics from CloudWatch Logs to an S3 data lake, with a Lambda function transforming the data into Parquet format for efficient querying. Amazon Athena enables SQL analytics on this data, with pre-configured partition projection eliminating the need for Glue crawlers. This architecture supports queries spanning months of historical data while keeping costs minimal through columnar storage and lifecycle policies.

## Authentication Flow

The authentication flow begins when Claude Code requests AWS credentials through the AWS CLI. The CLI invokes our credential process executable, which initiates an OAuth2 flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) to ensure security without requiring client secrets. A browser window opens automatically, directing the user to their organization's identity provider for authentication.

After successful authentication, the identity provider redirects back to the local callback server with an authorization code. The credential process exchanges this code for OIDC tokens. The system then uses one of two authentication methods to obtain AWS credentials:

### Authentication Methods

The system supports two authentication methods:

**Direct IAM Federation**
- Uses IAM OIDC Provider with STS AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity
- Direct federation from OIDC tokens to AWS credentials
- Configurable session duration up to 12 hours

**Cognito Identity Pool**
- Uses Amazon Cognito Identity Pool as federation broker
- Cognito manages the OIDC to AWS credential exchange
- Configurable session duration up to 8 hours

The authentication method is selected during initial configuration and both methods provide full CloudTrail attribution through session tags. These credentials include session tags containing the user's email and subject claim, ensuring every subsequent API call to Amazon Bedrock can be attributed to the specific user.

The temporary credentials are returned to Claude Code through the standard AWS CLI credential process protocol. The entire flow operates without any client secrets or long-lived credentials, following zero-trust security principles. Credentials are cached securely using either the operating system's keyring service or encrypted session files, preventing repeated authentication requests during the session lifetime.

## AWS CLI Credential Process Protocol

The solution leverages the [AWS CLI external credential process](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sourcing-external.html), a feature that allows custom credential providers to integrate with AWS CLI. When the AWS CLI needs credentials for a profile configured with `credential_process`, it executes the specified program and expects JSON-formatted temporary credentials on stdout.

Our implementation returns credentials in the exact format required by the AWS CLI:

```json
{
  "Version": 1,
  "AccessKeyId": "ASIA...",
  "SecretAccessKey": "...",
  "SessionToken": "...",
  "Expiration": "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Package Distribution Architecture

The packaging and distribution system bridges the gap between IT administrators who deploy infrastructure and end users who need simple, foolproof installation. The `ccwb package` command creates a self-contained distribution that includes everything users need without requiring technical expertise.

The packaging system uses Go cross-compilation (`ccwb package --go`) to produce native statically-linked binaries for all 5 platforms from a single machine, replacing the previous PyInstaller (macOS/Linux) and Nuitka/CodeBuild (Windows) build pipeline. The binaries are generic — they contain zero customer-specific data and work for all deployments.

The `ccwb package --go` command cross-compiles the binaries and generates customer-specific `config.json` (with federation config, quota settings) and `settings.json` (with Bedrock model, OTel endpoint) from the admin's profile. Only Go 1.24+ is required — no Docker, CodeBuild, or platform-specific toolchains needed.

The package embeds the configuration created during deployment, including the federation identifier (role ARN or identity pool ID) read from the profile. Generic install scripts (`install.sh`, `install.bat`, `ccwb-install.ps1`) read profile names and regions from `config.json` at install time, so they work for any customer without regeneration.

For organizations with monitoring enabled, the package also includes the OTEL helper executable and Claude Code settings. This provides a complete solution from authentication through telemetry without requiring users to understand the underlying complexity.

## Configuration Architecture

## Security Architecture

The security architecture addresses several threat vectors inherent in enterprise authentication systems. Each design decision directly mitigates specific risks while maintaining usability.

Credential theft represents the most common attack vector in authentication systems. Traditional long-lived API keys create persistent risk - once stolen, they remain valid until manually revoked. Our architecture eliminates this risk by using only temporary credentials that expire automatically. These credentials typically last one hour, with a maximum configurable lifetime of eight hours. Even if credentials are somehow compromised, the attacker's window of opportunity is limited and closes automatically.

The OAuth2 authorization flow itself presents opportunities for interception attacks. An attacker who intercepts an authorization code could potentially exchange it for tokens. We implement PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange, RFC 7636) which generates a dynamic code verifier for each authentication request. This makes intercepted codes useless without the corresponding verifier. Additionally, a cryptographically random state parameter prevents cross-site request forgery attacks.

Token storage on end-user machines requires careful consideration. We provide two storage options: integration with the operating system's keyring service, which provides encrypted storage with OS-level access controls, or session files with restricted filesystem permissions. Both approaches prevent other users or processes from accessing stored credentials. The system automatically cleans up expired credentials to minimize the attack surface.

Privilege escalation attempts are contained through IAM policy design. The federated role grants only the minimum permissions required to invoke Bedrock models in specified regions. Session tags embedded in every credential set ensure that users cannot access resources beyond their authorization. These tags flow through to CloudTrail, creating an immutable audit trail.

Every API call to Amazon Bedrock includes the user's subject identifier. This means that CloudTrail captures these tags with every request, providing complete attribution. Authentication events through Cognito are similarly logged, creating a comprehensive security audit trail from login through API usage.

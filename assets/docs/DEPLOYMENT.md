# Enterprise Deployment Guide

This guide walks IT administrators through deploying Claude Code authentication across your organization, transforming your existing identity provider into a gateway for secure Amazon Bedrock access.

> **Prerequisites**: See the [main README](../../README.md#prerequisites) for detailed requirements. You'll need AWS administrative access, an OIDC identity provider, and Python with Poetry installed.

## The Deployment Process

Deploying Claude Code authentication involves four key phases: configuring your identity provider, deploying AWS infrastructure, creating distribution packages, and supporting your users. Each phase builds on the previous one, creating a complete authentication solution that's transparent to end users.

## Phase 1: Configuring Your Identity Provider

The journey begins in your organization's identity provider console. Whether you're using Okta, Azure AD, or Auth0, you'll create a new application that serves as the authentication gateway for Claude Code.

Log into your provider's admin console and navigate to the application creation section. You're creating what's known as a "Native Application" in OIDC terms - this tells the provider that users will authenticate from their local machines rather than a web server. Name it something clear like "Claude Code Authentication" or "Amazon Bedrock CLI Access" so users recognize it during login.

The critical configuration involves setting up the OAuth2 flow with specific parameters. Enable "Authorization Code" and "Refresh Token" grant types, which allow secure authentication and token renewal. The redirect URI must be exactly `http://localhost:8400/callback` - this is where the authentication process returns after users log in. Request the standard OIDC scopes: `openid`, `profile`, and `email`. Most importantly, enable PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange), which provides security without requiring client secrets.

> **Provider-Specific Guides**: For detailed instructions specific to your identity provider, see our guides for [Okta](providers/okta-setup.md), [Azure AD](providers/microsoft-entra-id-setup.md), or [Auth0](providers/auth0-setup.md).

Next, determine who should have access. The cleanest approach is creating a dedicated group like "Claude Code Users" and assigning it to the application. This gives you centralized control over access - simply add users to the group to grant access, or remove them to revoke it. Apply any additional policies your organization requires, such as MFA or device trust requirements.

Before moving on, note two critical values from your application configuration: the provider domain (like `company.okta.com` or `login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/v2.0`) and the Client ID. You'll need these for the AWS infrastructure deployment.

## Phase 2: Deploying AWS Infrastructure

With your identity provider configured, it's time to deploy the AWS infrastructure that bridges your organization's authentication to Amazon Bedrock. Start by cloning the repository and installing the deployment tools:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/guidance-for-claude-code-with-amazon-bedrock
cd guidance-for-claude-code-with-amazon-bedrock/source
poetry install
```

The `ccwb` (Claude Code with Bedrock) CLI tool guides you through deployment with an interactive wizard. Run `poetry run ccwb init` to begin. The wizard walks you through each configuration decision, starting with your OIDC provider details - enter the domain and Client ID you noted earlier.

The wizard asks you to choose an authentication method. You can select either Direct IAM federation or Cognito Identity Pool based on your organization's requirements. Both methods provide secure OIDC federation to AWS credentials.

Next, you'll select your Claude model and configure regional access. Choose from available Claude models (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku) and select a cross-region inference profile (US, Europe, or APAC) for optimal performance. The wizard will then prompt you to select a source region within your chosen profile for model inference. Finally, choose where to deploy the authentication infrastructure (typically your primary AWS region) and configure optional monitoring setup, which provides usage analytics and cost tracking through OpenTelemetry.

Once configuration is complete, deploy the infrastructure with:

```bash
poetry run ccwb deploy
```

This single command orchestrates the creation of multiple AWS resources. Depending on your chosen authentication method, it creates either an IAM OIDC Provider or a Cognito Identity Pool to establish the trust relationship with your identity provider. IAM roles and policies grant precisely scoped Bedrock access.

The stacks deployed by `ccwb deploy` depend on the monitoring mode selected during `ccwb init`:

- **Central mode**: Deploys networking, s3bucket, monitoring, dashboard, and analytics stacks (ECS Fargate collector shared by all users).
- **Sidecar mode**: Deploys only the dashboard stack. The OpenTelemetry collector runs locally on each developer's machine, so no server-side networking or monitoring infrastructure is needed.

> **Deployment Options**: For more control, see the [CLI Reference](CLI_REFERENCE.md) for deploying specific stacks or using dry-run mode.

## Phase 3: Creating Distribution Packages

With infrastructure deployed, you're ready to create the package that end users will install.

### Multi-Platform Build Support

Claude Code supports building for all major platforms:

```bash
# Build for all platforms (recommended)
poetry run ccwb package --target-platform=all

# Build for specific platforms
poetry run ccwb package --target-platform=windows    # Windows via CodeBuild
poetry run ccwb package --target-platform=macos      # Current macOS architecture
poetry run ccwb package --target-platform=linux      # Linux via Docker
```

**Build Modes:**

| Mode | Flag | Requirements | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Go cross-compile** (recommended) | `--go` | Go 1.24+ installed | All admins — fast, all platforms from one machine |
| **Legacy** | (none) | PyInstaller, Docker, CodeBuild | Backward compatibility with Python binaries |

With `--go`, all 5 platforms (macOS ARM64/Intel, Linux x64/ARM64, Windows) are always available regardless of the admin's OS. No Docker, CodeBuild, or platform-specific toolchains required.

This command reads federation configuration from the admin profile (saved during `ccwb deploy`), cross-compiles native Go binaries, and generates customer-specific `config.json` and `settings.json` files.

**Legacy build mode (PyInstaller / Nuitka / Docker):**

PyInstaller emits binaries in the host OS's native format, so the build host must match the target OS. Only Windows (via CodeBuild) escapes this constraint.

| Target binary | Build host required | Tooling |
|---|---|---|
| `macos-arm64`, `macos-intel` | **macOS** | PyInstaller (native) |
| `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64` | Linux, **or** macOS with Docker Desktop | PyInstaller (Docker container when building from macOS) |
| `windows` | any host | AWS CodeBuild (remote) |

**Linux admins cannot produce macOS binaries** — see [CLI Reference: Platform Support](CLI_REFERENCE.md#platform-support-hybrid-build-system) for details. The package command refuses this combination with a clear error; to produce macOS binaries use a macOS workstation, a CI macOS runner, or an EC2 Mac instance.

- **Windows**: Uses Nuitka via AWS CodeBuild
  - Optimized for performance and minimal antivirus false positives
- **macOS**: Uses PyInstaller with architecture-specific builds
  - ARM64: Native build on Apple Silicon Macs only — cannot run on Intel Macs
  - Intel: Runs natively on Intel Macs and on Apple Silicon via Rosetta — covers all Mac users with one binary
  - Cross-arch: **Optional** — build the other architecture from your current Mac; requires a universal2 Python (see below)
- **Linux x64/ARM64**: Uses PyInstaller in Docker containers (cross-compiled from macOS)
  - Automatically builds both architectures when Docker is available
  - Docker Desktop handles architecture emulation via Rosetta
  - **When building from macOS, requires Docker Desktop installed and running** — if absent, Linux builds are skipped with a warning and all other platforms continue normally
  - macOS and Windows builds have no dependency on Docker

**Which macOS binary should you ship?**

| Your developer fleet | Recommended binary | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Apple Silicon only | `macos-arm64` | Native, no extra setup |
| Intel only | `macos-intel` | Native, no extra setup |
| Mixed (or unknown) | `macos-intel` | Covers everyone — runs natively on Intel, via Rosetta on Apple Silicon |
| Performance-conscious mixed fleet | Both `macos-arm64` + `macos-intel` | Installer picks the right one per device |

> **Rosetta translation:** Intel (`x86_64`) binaries run on Apple Silicon via Apple's Rosetta 2 translation layer — users don't need to do anything. ARM64 binaries cannot run on Intel Macs at all.

**Optional: Cross-arch macOS Builds (legacy mode only)**

By default, legacy-mode `ccwb package` builds only for your Mac's own architecture (arm64 on Apple Silicon, x86_64 on Intel). To build for the other architecture — for example, an Apple Silicon admin building the Intel binary to cover Intel Mac users — install a universal2 Python:

1. Download the **macOS 64-bit universal2 installer** for Python 3.12 from [python.org/downloads/macos](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/)
2. Run the installer — it places Python at `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/`
3. Re-run `ccwb package` — it detects the universal2 Python automatically and builds both architectures

On first cross-arch build, `ccwb` creates an isolated build environment at `~/.ccwb/build-venvs/` (~30s). Subsequent runs reuse it.

Without universal2 Python: `--target-platform=all` skips the cross-arch target with a note and continues normally. Explicitly requesting the cross-arch target (e.g. `--target-platform=macos-intel` on Apple Silicon) fails with a clear error pointing to the python.org installer.

(Cross-arch builds are not needed with `--go` — Go cross-compiles all platforms natively.)

The resulting `dist/` folder contains everything users need:

- Platform-specific executables (`credential-process-<platform>`) handle the OAuth2 authentication flow
- The configuration file includes all necessary settings
- Intelligent installer scripts (`install.sh` for Unix, `install.bat` + `ccwb-install.ps1` for Windows) detect the user's architecture and set up their AWS profile automatically
- If you enabled monitoring, OTEL helper executables and Claude Code telemetry settings that point to your OpenTelemetry collector

### Windows Build System (Optional)

Windows binary builds use AWS CodeBuild with Nuitka for optimal performance. Windows support is optional and configured during the `init` process:

1. **Enable during init**: When running `poetry run ccwb init`, you'll be prompted:

   ```
   Enable Windows build support via AWS CodeBuild? (y/N)
   ```

   If you answer "yes", the CodeBuild stack will be deployed automatically when you run `deploy`.

2. **If enabled**, Windows builds will automatically trigger when you run:

   ```bash
   poetry run ccwb package --target-platform=all
   # or specifically for Windows:
   poetry run ccwb package --target-platform=windows
   ```

3. **Monitor build progress**:
   ```bash
   poetry run ccwb builds
   ```

**Important Notes:**

- Windows builds are completely optional - the package will work without them
- If CodeBuild is not enabled, Windows builds will be silently skipped
- Windows builds take 20+ minutes
- To enable Windows builds after initial setup, re-run `poetry run ccwb init`

## Phase 4: Testing Your Deployment

Before distributing to users, thoroughly test the package to ensure everything works as expected. The CLI provides a comprehensive test command that simulates exactly what end users will experience:

```bash
poetry run ccwb test
```

This test runs through the complete user journey. It executes the installer in a temporary directory, configures the AWS profile, triggers the authentication flow, and verifies access to Amazon Bedrock. Watch as it opens a browser window for authentication - this is exactly what your users will see.

For more thorough validation, add the `--api` flag to make actual Bedrock API calls:

```bash
poetry run ccwb test --api
```

## Phase 5: Distributing to Your Users

With a tested package in hand, you're ready for the final phase: getting the authentication system to your users. Claude Code offers two distribution methods:

### Option 1: Secure URL Distribution

Generate a presigned URL for easy, secure distribution without requiring AWS credentials:

```bash
# Create distribution with 48-hour expiration
poetry run ccwb distribute

# Or specify custom expiration (up to 7 days)
poetry run ccwb distribute --expires-hours=72
```

The command uploads your package to S3 and generates a secure, time-limited URL. Share this URL with developers via email, Slack, or your internal wiki. Users download and run the installer - no AWS credentials required.

### Option 2: Manual Distribution

Share the `dist/` folder through your normal software distribution channels - perhaps a shared drive, internal website, or artifact repository.

**Installation by Platform:**

- **Windows**: Users run `install.bat`
- **macOS/Linux**: Users run `chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh`

Regardless of distribution method, the user experience remains simple. They receive the package, run the installer for their platform, and they're done. The installer:

- Detects their operating system and architecture
- Installs the appropriate binary
- Configures their AWS profile
- Sets up the credential process
- Handles all the complex authentication machinery invisibly

When they run Claude Code with `AWS_PROFILE=ClaudeCode`, authentication happens automatically in the background. On first use, users will see a browser window open for authentication with your organization's identity provider.
